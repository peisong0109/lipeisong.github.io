The existing practice of creating structure plans in urban design seems to be arbitrary, and few practitioners consider employing algorithms(DL) to meet functional demands and minimize budgets.

RSU is crucial for the success of autonomous driving in the existing community, but urban design does not update simultaneously to devote a structure plan for considering the installation of RSUs.

We reached a consensus to propose a strategy that helps calculate the best layout for RSU in urban design, which is otherwise not easily used by urban designers.

We want to provide a platform that urban designers can use by inputting the road networks and estimated traffic volumes and outputting a plan for RSU.
