Fast-growing trees pose risks to the safety of the operation of overhead power lines. Flashovers can occur if the distance between trees and power lines is less than the safety range, resulting in short circuits of overhead lines. 
It has become imperative for electric utility companies to monitor the trees to prevent unexpected intrusions.

We propose to design an online monitoring method for overhead power lines against tree intrusion via a low-cost camera and mobile edge computing approach.

####  Method:

Step 1: Trees detection based on HSV colour space.

Step 2: Geometric analysis of the thin lens camera model.

Step 3: Edge Computing architecture is implemented.

####  Advantages:

(1) Accurate and quick measurement.

(2) Low cost of the operation.

(3) Continuous monitoring of power lines.
